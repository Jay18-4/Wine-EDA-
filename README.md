# Wine Dataset EDA

## Description
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Wine Dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset consists of 13 chemical properties for wines, categorized into three wine classes.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to:
- Explore the relationships between chemical properties of wine.
- Identify the most significant features for classifying wine types.
- Visualize the separation of wine classes.

## Tasks Performed
1. **Data Cleaning & Inspection**:
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and data types.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Plotted histograms to visualize feature distributions.
   - Identified skewness and outliers.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Compared features like Alcohol and Flavanoids against wine class.
   - Used boxplots and KDE plots to highlight differences between classes.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Generated a heatmap to identify strong correlations between features.

5. **Feature Importance**:
   - Found the most significant features (e.g., Flavanoids, Total Phenols).

6. **Insights**:
   - Class 1 wines had the highest Alcohol and Flavanoids.
   - Class 3 wines had the highest Color Intensity.
   - Flavanoids, Total Phenols, and OD280/OD315 of diluted wines were key features for classification.
